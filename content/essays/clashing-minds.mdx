description: How I understood what the difference between a coder and a founder is.
---
Me and [Kien](https://warpcast.com/kienfam) have originally met during
*Kyiv Tech Summit Hackathon* which took place in 2022.
It was founded by [CJ](https://warpcast.com/cjh) and [Rev](https://warpcast.com/rev)
who have decided to contribute to the foundation of Ukranian-based Web3 founders.

In 2021 I started working for a cryptocurrency exchange, as a frontend engineer.
I got bored quickly and wanted to touch cryptopunk world of mayhem myself –
I asked for it, and got it. I worked on a Web3 product that involved stacking,
liquidity provisioning, and eventually got my hands really deep into Solidity,
world of AMMs and applied math.

That didn't last for long.
After months of exciting Web3 work, I was shifted to work on a Telegram Bot,
that didn't even communicate with the blockchain, but only queried an internal
crypto-processing API.
I got bored very quickly again.

That was about time when I found out about the *Kyiv Tech Summit Hackathon*,
and decided it's just what I need – I can get more friends, build cool stuff,
and potentially start my own thing.

Although my Web3 skills were silly back then, we've won an
[award](https://devpost.com/software/tok3nised) for a "Most impactful project built on Ethereum".
That lit a spark in us, and we decided to go forward, with a vision that
**what theoretically can be tokenized – will be**.

Straight after, Kien has left his full-time job to be the **brain** of just-founded
company, but I stayed and thought that my part-time involvement would complement
the copmany enough as I keep being the **ultimate soldier**, coding anything that
requires to be done.
> Financial comfort had a price to pay, but I realized it one year after.

We also had a third cofounder, Ivan. He's a great guy, but has set irrational
expectations with huge personal financial risk exposure, and had to quit the next
quarter.

**Since then, we've came through 3 pivots, having none of them to reach the 
public release.**

Having a technical mind, I've always been striving for perfect solutions.
Building your own project lets *you* to decide everything, but also *you* are
the only one to blame your code. I was learning fast and was quickly realizing
most of the things I wrote were crap, so I always spent extra time refactoring,
squeezing the "nicest" set up I could possibly squeeze.

That contributed to my coding skills a lot, but didn't contribute to the product
at all. Being an **ultimate soldier** was not enough to get a good thing out.

I've worked at least 13 hours a day, grinding my 9-5 and coding at startup after,
and always thought – *"I'm not the brain, I'm the weapon"*. I let Kien brainstorm
all the stuff and figured out having me implementing *his* ideas would work out.
I thought that I don't have time to *think*, I only have time to *act*. I believe,
Kien thought the same.

Having pivoted 3 times, I finally asked myself – **what the fuck are we actually
building?** Who will use it? What's the target audience? How can this be sustainable?

It turned out I had a completely different point of view, I had it the whole time.
I was always quitting the discussion early, leaving Kien's argument win on a point
of "trust". He's a great founder, but also a hard guy to convince something about.

That was a harsh reality. We've had long debates on my doubts, but never found a
confluence. We've built **a new, innovative product, that was doomed to fail.**

Kien had discovered memecoin launchpads, such as [pump.fun](https://pump.fun),
and was talking offtopic about it.
Having my fingers sharpened and [*founder mode*](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html)
turned on, I've seen an opportunity.

We're noones. Noone knows about us, as we built in the shadow. We never grew our personal
audiences. I knew that fundraising a considerable amount of money to make something innovative
or creating a new market required good connections, that we both lacked of.

I then proposed to not invent the wheel, but take something that already exists –
and make it better. I've seen the UX flaws of potential competitors, I've even saw their
awful coding skills in my Chrome Devtools.

That's how [beliefs.social](https://beliefs.social) started.

We still debate on many things, but we've found out that when we do, we get to
make good decisions. It's just like cold shower, *you won't get used to it, but
with time, you'll get more prepared for it – mindfully and emotionally*.
